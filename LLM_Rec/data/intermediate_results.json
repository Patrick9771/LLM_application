    "rec": "Based on the user profile (male, 25-34, writer, enjoys Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Romance, and Action, with recent watches like *Natural Born Killers*, *Liar Liar*, and *Awakenings*), here are three tailored recommendations from the 1995 film list, along with reasons:\n\n### 1. **Seven (Se7en) (1995)**  \n   - **Why?** This psychological thriller aligns with the user’s preference for dark, gripping narratives (*Natural Born Killers*) and drama. Its intense plot and literary undertones (the killer’s obsession with symbolism) would appeal to a writer. The film’s critical acclaim (likely matching the user’s 4-star+ ratings) and genre blend (Thriller/Drama) make it a strong fit.\n\n### 2. **Get Shorty (1995)**  \n   - **Why?** A sharp blend of comedy and crime thriller, this film’s witty dialogue and satirical take on Hollywood (*Liar Liar*’s comedic tone but with a darker edge) would resonate with a writer. The user’s enjoyment of both comedy and action is met here, and its clever storytelling could appeal to their creative side.\n\n### 3. **Leaving Las Vegas (1995)**  \n   - **Why?** A raw, dramatic character study (*Awakenings*’ emotional depth) with a tragic romance at its core. The protagonist’s self-destructive journey and poetic dialogue might captivate a writer, while the film’s unflinching drama matches the user’s appreciation for complex narratives.\n\n**Bonus Note:** If the user leans more toward action, *Heat (1995)* could substitute for its heist thrills and dramatic weight, but the above selections better balance their eclectic tastes.",
